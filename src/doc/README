**** THIS DIRECTORY WAS NOT UPDATED FOR RELEASE 4.1 - IT IS EXACTLY
**** AS IT WAS FOR RELEASE 4.0.1.  THE USER MANUAL, RELEASE NOTES,
**** AND INSTALLATION GUIDE (postgres-setup.me) HAVE BEEN MOVED TO
**** THE DIRECTORY "../doc" AND IS MORE CURRENT.  FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
**** WE PLAN A TOTAL OVERHAUL ON THE DOCUMENTATION.

Directories:

    papers/

        Technical reports about Postgres

    implementation/

        bufmgr.doc        - buffer manager
        amiint.doc      - "backend" program protocol

        executor/*      - old executor implementation notes
        planner/*       - old planner implementation notes

    psdump/

        Postscript dump of papers using illustrations.  You will need to use
        these if you do not have GRN.  If these do not work or you do not have a
        Postscript printer, use the "eatgrn" script in place of GRN in the
        print scripts - this will get rid of the GRN data and allow you to
        print these files without the illustrations.  The Postscript versions
        of these files are printed on an Apple Laserwriter.

    tutorials/

        Postgres tutorials

To print these files, use the print script in this directory.
Set the PRINTER="-P <printer>" variable to the name of your site's printer,
or you may use 

% print -P <printer> filename

Papers with pictures in them are available in Postscript format in the
directory psdump.

File Name Conventions:

<name>.me  - Standard TROFF file using me macros.  This is all we use.
             These files may include calls to deqn, dtbl, and ideal.

<name>.grn - Same as above, but with embedded GRN pictures.  Postscript dumps
             are distributed for the convienence of those who do not have
             access to GRN (a GREMLIN preprocessor for TROFF).

<name>.doc - Flat ASCII files - just send directly to your line printer.

<name>.ps  - Postscript files - these should be sent directly to your line
			 printer IF it is a laser printer.
