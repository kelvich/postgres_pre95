File Name Conventions:

<name>.me  - Standard TROFF file using -me macros.  This is all we use.
             These files may include calls to deqn, dtbl, and ideal.

<name>.grn - Same as above, but with embedded GRN pictures.  PostScript 
	     dumps are distributed for the convienence of those who do 
	     not have access to GRN (a GREMLIN preprocessor for TROFF).

<name>.doc - Flat ASCII files - just send directly to your line printer.

<name>.ps  - PostScript files - these may be sent directly to your 
             PostScript laser printer.
