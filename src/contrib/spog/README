Juergen Schoenwaelder's original README file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the source to spog, a simple replacement
for the postgres monitor. spog uses the readline library written
by the GNU people. Using spog, you can easily edit your last query
which is very useful during the development of 'standard' queries.

To install spog just edit the Makefile and type make. Set POSTGRESHOME
to the directory where postgres lives and PORT to the machine name
for which postgres has been compiled. RLINC should point to the
header files of GNU's readline library (make sure that history.h
is installed).

Version 1.1 now supports postgres 4.0 and has some new stuff. You can
now define the default format for attributes and there are two more options:

     -x   Print commands as they are executed.
     -n   Don't read the file ~/.spogrc.

I found them useful for writing some scripts to get info on a postgres
database. The pg_info script runs some queries on the system catalog
to display all datatypes, user defined relations, indexes anmd rules.
Improvements to this script are very welcome since I am not a system
relations expert. NOTE: The joins needed are very very slow. A previous
version did the join in an awk script and it was much faster :-).

Another script pg_edit allows you to edit the contents of a relation
in an editor and to store the contents back. I do not recommend to
use it! !

POSTGRES group comments
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
spog has been successfully tested on 
	DEC MIPS machines running Ultrix 4.2 
	Sun SPARC machines running SunOS 4.1.2
using readline 1.2 and POSTGRES 4.1.

I decided against installing the scripts by default since Juergen
recommends against their use (well, in the case of pg_edit, anyway).

It also appears to work on a
	DEC 5000/240 (MIPS) running Ultrix 4.3a
	DEC 3000/500X (Alpha AXP) running OSF/1 1.3
	Sun SS10/31 running SunOS 4.1.3
	H-P 9000/877 running HP-UX 9.00
