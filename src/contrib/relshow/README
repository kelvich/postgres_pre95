  README for relshow	 David J. Hughes (bambi@Bond.edu.au)  Jan-1993
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

relshow will display structure information for a Postgres database.  It can 
be used in 3 ways  :-

	"relshow"			list known databases
	"relshow <DBname>"		list relations in database <DBname>
	"relshow <DBname> <RelName>"	list fields in relation

To clarify the output, it will not show the "catalog" relations (i.e.  pg_*)
in the database.  You may still specifiy such a relation if you wish to
check out the structure (eg. relshow postgres pg_attribute).  It also
only shows the "user defined" fields within a relation (which is
probably what you want to see anyway).  Therefore, if you define a
relation with 3 fields, it will show those 3 fields (not the internal
postgres fields that are also contained in each relation).

To compile relshow, use

	cc -I../../lib/H -o relshow relshow.c ../../../YourObjDir/libpq.a


There are some routines in relshow.c that are extracted from a database
interface library I wrote for an application I'm developing.  They may
be of use to you in your work (or maybe not).  They just simplify data
retrieval and present the data in a readily usable manner.

Comments etc. sent to bambi@Bond.edu.au are most welcome.

Tiny little app, seems to work ok on the platforms I tried.
