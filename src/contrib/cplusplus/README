Therg are two sections to this file:
	- Justin Smith's original README file.
	- Comments added by people in the POSTGRES group.

Justin Smith's original README file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a MINIMAL package for accessing Postgres databases
from C++

The relevant class is in the file pg.h.  tst.c is a sample program
that uses this class to access a database named 'jsmith'.

You must modify the Makefile so that SD points to the directory that
contains the modified header files (this is the directory that
contains tst.c, after you uncompress and untar this stuff).

POSTGRES group comments
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library has been successfully tested on 
	DEC MIPS machines running Ultrix 4.2 
	Sun SPARC machines running SunOS 4.1.3
using cfront 1.1.0 (CenterLine r1.0)/GNU g++ 2.3.3 and POSTGRES 4.1.

I hacked on Justin's code quite a bit so that (1) it would compile
more cleanly and (2) we could use the existing POSTGRES header files
without modification.  The 'extern "C"' hack seems to work ok for
both of the C++ compilers that I tried.  Your mileage may vary.

Using CC, expect to see something like
	cpp: warning tmp/c.h:263: signed redefined
	cpp: warning tmp/c.h:678: offsetof redefined
