The software contained in the directories below was contributed to the
project by people outside of UC Berkeley.  We do not make any
guarantees that they will compile on any given operating system, let
alone work correctly.  (In fact, some of these programs are
*extremely* OS-dependent.)  We will also not provide any help with
this software should you have difficulties with it.  It is provided
here solely in the hope that you may find it useful in some way.  You
are totally on your own.

Read the README file in each subdirectory to see what software we have
succeeded in building on our own systems.
