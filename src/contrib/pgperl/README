Igor Metz's original README file

This is version 1.0 beta of pgperl.

PGPERL?
-------

Pgperl is a version of Larry Wall's language perl which allows you to use
Postgres from within perl. This has been done by using the C function
interface of perl which calls the Postgres version 2.0 C library libpq.

In order to build pgperl, you need the following stuff:

 o Pgperl, available from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].
 o Postgres version 2.0, available from postgres.berkeley.edu [128.32.149.1]
   or from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].
 o Perl 3.0, patchlevel 28, available from jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov
   [128.149.1.143] or from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].

The pgperl distribution contains the following files:

README		  This file.
Makefile	  guess :-)
pg-libpg.mus	  The 'mus' code for the Postgres - Perl Interface.
pg-mus		  A perl script to convert pg-libpg.mus	to pg-libpg.c.
usersub.c	  A C function which will be called by perl to initialize the
		  Postgres - Perl Interface.
testlibpq.pl	  A pgperl script which shows you, how you can use Postgres
		  from within perl.

Pgperl has been written on a Sun SparcStation 1 under SunOS 4.0.3. I do not
know, how well it works on other machines.

Please address bug reports to Igor Metz <metz@iam.unibe.ch>. Do not expect
rapid responses.

Robert Withrow's original README file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a modified version of pgperl.  It was modified from what was
distributed with Postgres 4.0.1.  See pg-libpq.mus for info on what
I modified.  I also enhanced testlibpq.pl to call most of the functions.

Copyright 1993 Robert Withrow all rights reserved.
I don't care what you do with this just as long as you don't blame me.
You may distribute it under the terms of Igor Metz's README file.  Please
see that file for more information.

WHAT TO DO WITH THIS
--------------------

This stuff *replaces* the contents of the src/contrib/pgperl directory in
the Postgres 4.0.1 distribution.  Thus you want to do something like:

  cd /usr/postgres/src/contrib/pgperl
  rm *
  unshar <thisfile>

CHANGES FROM INSTRUCTIONS IN IGOR METZ'S README
-----------------------------------------------
This was tested and worked with:

  - Perl 4 PL 19
  - Postgres V4.0.1
  - Interactive SVR4.0.3.0 on a 386 using the standard CCS

You *must* have both Perl and Postgres running *and installed* to make
this work.

Once you have them running *and installed*, edit ``Makefile'' and try
to build it.

If you have problems, fix them youself.  I *may* be able to help if
you have problems, but probably not since I am generally as busy as a
one-eyed cat watching three mouseholes.  If you fix something, please
let me know.

The file testlibpq.out contains the results of running testlibpq.pl, so
your results should look something like this...

POSTGRES group comments
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RWW's changes have been successfully tested on DEC MIPS machines running 
Ultrix 4.2, using PERL 4 pl 35 and POSTGRES 4.1.  Thanks, Robert.

Under Ultrix, expect to see the following warnings:
	cpp: warning /usr/include/sys/param.h:389: MIN redefined
	cpp: warning /usr/include/sys/param.h:390: MAX redefined
since these are also defined in tmp/c.h.

The default MIPS Ultrix compilers are not standard C, nor does the
Ultrix library conform to what perl thinks a non-STDC library should
look like (e.g., char *memcpy() and char *memset()) so expect to have
to hack on perl/perl.h to make perl applications (like this one) compile.
I just changed perl.h so that memcpy and memset returned void *.
