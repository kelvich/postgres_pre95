PGPERL?
-------

Pgperl is a version of Larry Wall's language perl which allows you to use
Postgres from within perl. This has been done by using the C function
interface of perl which calls the Postgres version 2.0 C library libpq.

In order to build pgperl, you need the following stuff:

 o Pgperl, available from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].
 o Postgres version 2.0, available from postgres.berkeley.edu [128.32.149.1]
   or from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].
 o Perl 3.0, patchlevel 28, available from jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov
   [128.149.1.143] or from iamsun.unibe.ch [130.92.64.10].

The pgperl distribution contains the following files:

README		  This file.
Makefile	  guess :-)
pg-libpg.mus	  The 'mus' code for the Postgres - Perl Interface.
pg-mus		  A perl script to convert pg-libpg.mus	to pg-libpg.c.
usersub.c	  A C function which will be called by perl to initialize the
		  Postgres - Perl Interface.
testlibpq.pl	  A pgperl script which shows you, how you can use Postgres
		  from within perl.

Pgperl has been written on a Sun SparcStation 1 under SunOS 4.0.3. I do not
know, how well it works on other machines.

Please address bug reports to Igor Metz <metz@iam.unibe.ch>. Do not expect
rapid responses.
