Creating relation person:
query = create person (name = char16, age = int4, location = point)

Relation person before appends:
New tuple group:
name           age            location       

Appending to relation person:
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 50, location = "(50,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 60, location = "(60,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 70, location = "(70,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 80, location = "(80,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 90, location = "(90,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 100, location = "(100,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 110, location = "(110,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 120, location = "(120,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 130, location = "(130,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 140, location = "(140,10)"::point)
query = append person (name = "fred", age = 150, location = "(150,10)"::point)

Relation person after appends:
New tuple group:
name           age            location       
fred           50             (50,10)        
fred           60             (60,10)        
fred           70             (70,10)        
fred           80             (80,10)        
fred           90             (90,10)        
fred           100            (100,10)       
fred           110            (110,10)       
fred           120            (120,10)       
fred           130            (130,10)       
fred           140            (140,10)       
fred           150            (150,10)       

Testing copy:

Relation person after copy:
New tuple group:
name           age            location       
fred           50             (50,10)        
fred           60             (60,10)        
fred           70             (70,10)        
fred           80             (80,10)        
fred           90             (90,10)        
fred           100            (100,10)       
fred           110            (110,10)       
fred           120            (120,10)       
fred           130            (130,10)       
fred           140            (140,10)       
fred           150            (150,10)       
bill           21             (1,2)          
bob            61             (3,4)

Testing other things:
Opening 2 portals:
Number of portals open: 2
Portal names: eportal, fportal.
Portal eportal is not asynchronous.
Portal eportal has 14 tuples.
Portal eportal has 14 instances.
Portal eportal has 1 groups.
Portal eportal group 0 has 14 instances.
Portal eportal tuple 0 has 3 fields.
Portal eportal tuple 0 field 2 is 7 bytes long.
Portal eportal tuple 0 field 2 is type 600.
Portal eportal tuple 0 is in group 0.
Portal eportal tuple 0 field "location" is index 2.
Portal eportal tuple 0 field 1 is name "age".
Portal eportal tuples 0 and 1 are the same type.
Portal eportal group 0 field "location" is index 2.
Closing 2 portals:
Number of portals open: 0
Portal names: .

Removing from relation person:
query = delete person where person.age = 50 
query = delete person where person.age = 60 
query = delete person where person.age = 70 
query = delete person where person.age = 80 
query = delete person where person.age = 90 
query = delete person where person.age = 100 
query = delete person where person.age = 110 
query = delete person where person.age = 120 
query = delete person where person.age = 130 
query = delete person where person.age = 140 
query = delete person where person.age = 150 

Relation person after removes:
New tuple group:
name           age            location       
bill           21             (1,2)          
bob            61             (3,4)
