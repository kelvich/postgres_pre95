Rodrigo Fontecilla's original README file

Dear Postgres Users:

Here you have a couple of small utilities to browse your databases. 

They are posthelp and xposthelp.

posthelp is a standard UNIX command with some options that allow 
you to get information on your databases and tables. Here is a sample
of what you get: 

	TABLE   = airports
	KIND    = relation
	INDEXED = no
	OID     = 781728
	RECORDS = 6867

		Attribute		Type

		ainit    		text    
		factype  		text    
		aname    		text    
		ncity    		text    
		state    		text    
		elev     		int4    
		loc      		point    


If the table is an index you will get:

	TABLE   = amtk_ind
	KIND    = index
	INDEXED = no
	OID     = 4999491
	RECORDS = 665
	INDEX ON= amtk 
	KEYS    = bbox  

This is quite useful if you want to prepare a report on the 
status of your database.

xposthelp is an interactive X-window browser. You need XView to 
compile it (yes, I know Motif is what most of you like but, I'm 
stuck with XView for the time being). 

Edit the Makefile so that you have the right include subdirectory. 
Then just type 

	make 

Let me know what you think, if you find bugs, or if you would like 
more features added. 

My e-mail is:

	rodrigo@cmsun.cmf.nrl.navy.mil

Enjoy.

P.S. I have been working with 4.0.1 until now, so I do not know if this 
works with 4.1.

xposthelp only compiles on Sun SPARC machines running SunOS 4.1.x.
