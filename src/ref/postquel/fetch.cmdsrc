.uh NAME
.lp
fetch \*- fetch tuple(s) from a portal 
.uh SYNOPSIS
.lp
.b fetch
[ (
.b forward
|
.b backward
) ] [ ( number |
.b all
) ] [
.b in
portal_name
]
.uh DESCRIPTION
.lp
.b Fetch
allows a user to retrieve tuples from a portal named
.i portal_name .
The number of tuples retrieved is specified by
.i number .
If the number of tuples remaining in the portal is less than
.i number ,
then only those available are fetched.
Substituting the keyword
.b all
in place of a number will cause all remaining tuples in the portal
to be retrieved.
Tuples may be fetched in both
.i forward
and
.i backward
directions.
The default direction is 
.i forward .
.lp
Updating data in a portal is not supported by \*(PP,
because mapping portal updates back to base relations is impossible
in general as with view updates.
Consequently, users must issue
explicit replace commands to update data.
.uh EXAMPLE
.lp
.nf
/* Fetch all the tuples available in the portal FOO */
   fetch all in FOO
	
/* Fetch 5 tuples backward in the portal FOO */
   fetch backward 5 in FOO
.fi

close(commands),
move(commands).
.uh BUGS
.lp
Currently, the smallest transaction in POSTGRES is a single
POSTQUEL command.  It should be possible for a single fetch to be a transaction.
