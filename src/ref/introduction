.SH "OVERVIEW"
This document is the reference manual for the \*(PG database
management system under development at the University of California at
Berkeley.  The \*(PG project, led by Professor Michael Stonebraker, 
has been sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (\c
.SM DARPA\c
),
the Army Research Office (\c
.SM ARO\c
),
the National Science Foundation (\c
.SM NSF\c
),
and
.SM ESL\c
, Inc.
.PP
\*(PG is distributed in source code format and is the property of the
Regents of the University of California.  However, the University will
grant unlimited commercialization rights for any derived work on the
condition that it obtain an educational license to the derived work.
For further information, consult the Berkeley Campus Software Office,
295 Evans Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.  Note
that there is no organization who can help you with any bugs you may
encounter or with any other problems.  In other words, this is
.BR unsupported
software.
.SH "\*(PG DISTRIBUTION"
This reference describes Version \*(PV of \*(PG.  The \*(PG software
is about 200,000 lines of C code.  Information on obtaining the source
code is available from:

Version \*(PV has been tuned modestly.  Hence, on the Wisconsin
benchmark, one should expect performance about twice that of the
public domain, University of California version of \*(II, a relational
prototype from the late 1970s.
.PP
As distributed, \*(PG runs on Digital Equipment Corporation computers
based on
.SM MIPS
R2000 and R3000 processors (under Ultrix 4.2A and 4.3A), Digital
Equipment Corporation computers based on Alpha AXP (DECchip 21064)
processors (under OSF/1 1.3 and 2.0), Sun Microsystems computers based
on
.SM SPARC
processors (under SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.3), Hewlett-Packard Model
9000 Series 700 and 800 computers based on PA-RISC processors (under
HP-UX 9.00, 9.01 and 9.03), and International Business Machines
RS/6000 computers based on POWER processors (under AIX 3.2.5).  \*(PG
users have ported previous releases of the system to many other
architectures and operating systems, including
.SM NeXTSTEP ,
IRIX 5.1, Intel System V Release 4, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
.SH "\*(PG DOCUMENTATION"
This reference manual describes the functionality of Version \*(PV and
contains notations where appropriate to indicate which features are
not implemented in Version \*(PV.  Application developers should note
that this reference contains only the specification for the low-level
call-oriented application program interface, \*(LI.  A companion
volume, the \*(PG User Manual, contains tutorial examples of the ways
in which the system can be extended.
.PP
The remainder of this reference manual is structured as follows.  In
Section 2 (UNIX), we discuss the \*(PG capabilities that are available
directly from the operating system.  Section 3 (BUILT-INS) describes
\*(PG internal data types, functions, and operators.  Section 4
(COMMANDS) then describes \*(PQ, the language by which a user
interacts with a \*(PG database.  Then, Section 5 (LIBPQ) describes a
library of low level routines through which a user can formulate \*(PQ
queries from a C program and get appropriate return information back
to his program.  Next, Section 6 (FAST PATH) continues with a
description of a method by which applications may execute functions in
\*(PG with very high performance.  Section 7 (LARGE OBJECTS) describes
the internal \*(PG interface for accessing large objects.  Section 8
(SYSTEM CATALOGS) gives a brief explanation of the tables used
internally by \*(PG.  The reference concludes with Section 9 (FILES),
a collection of file format descriptions for files used by \*(PG.

Liverpool) and Sebastian Fernandez (University of California at
Berkeley).  The initial AIX port was performed by Rafael Morales
Gamboa (ITESM Campus Morelos, Cuernavaca).  Carl Staelin of H-P
Laboratories and Steve Miley of UCSB/CRSEO provided the computing
resources that enabled us to integrate these ports into the \*(PG
distribution.

Marc Teitelbaum served as chief programmer for Version \*(PV and was
responsible for overall coordination of the project.
