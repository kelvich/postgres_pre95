.XA 0 "Section 1 \*- Introduction"
.uh OVERVIEW
.lp
This document is the reference manual for the \*(PP database system
under development at the University of California, Berkeley.
This project,
led by Professors Michael Stonebraker and Lawrence A. Rowe,
is sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
.r ( \c
.A DARPA ),
the
Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF),
.A 3M 
Corp, and
.A ESL ,
Inc.

\*(PP is distributed in source code format and is
the property of the Regents of the University of California.
However, the University will grant unlimited commercialization
rights for any derived work on the condition that it obtain an
educational license to the derived work.
For further information, consult the Berkeley Campus Software Office,
295 Evans Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.
Moreover, there is no organization who can help you
with any bugs you may encounter or with any other problems.
In other words,
this is
.b unsupported
software.
.uh "POSTGRES DISTRIBUTION"
.sp
This manual describes Version 2.1 of POSTGRES.  The POSTGRES software is
about 170,000 lines of C code, and is available for SUN 3 and
SUN 4 class machines, for DECstation 3100 machines and for
the SEQUENT Symetry machine.
Information on obtaining the source code for these computers is
available from:

.sp
No
attempt has been made to optimize Version 2.1;
consequently, one
should expect
performance comparable to the public domain,
University of
California Version of \*(II, a relational prototype
from the late 1970s.
.sp
This manual contains the description of a few capabilities
which are not implemented in Version 2.1.  We expect to support
additional functionality in Version 3, currently scheduled for third quarter 1991. 
Moreover, Version 3
will be tuned to run as fast as possible.

.uh "POSTGRES DOCUMENTATION"
.lp
This
reference manual describes the functionality of Versions 2.1, and 3
and contains
notations where appropriate to indicate which features are not implemented in
Version 2.1.
Application developers should note that
this reference manual contains only the specification for
the low-level call-oriented application program interface,
LIBPQ.
In addition, a companion project directed by Professor Rowe is
building a collection of powerful development tools called
.b \*(OF ,
which will be the subject of a separate reference manual.
.lp
The remainder of this manual is structured as follows.
In Section 2,
we discuss the \*(PP capabilities that are available directly
from the operating system.
Section 3 then describes \*(PQ,
the language by which a user interacts with a
\*(PP database.
Then,
Section 4 describes
a library of low level routines through which a user can
formulate \*(PQ queries from a
C program and get appropriate
return information back to his program.
Next,
Section 5 continues with a description of
a method by which applications may execute functions in \*(PP
with very high performance.
The manual concludes with Section 6,
a collection of
file format descriptions
for files used by \*(PP.
.uh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.lp
\*(PP has been constructed by a team of undergraduate, graduate, and
staff programmers.
The Version 2.1 contributors (in alphabetical order) consisted of 
James Bell,
Ron Choi,
Jeffrey Goh,
Wei Hong,
Anant Jhingran,
Greg Kemnitz,
Michael Olson,
Lay-Peng Ong,
Spyros Potamianos,
and Cimarron Taylor.
.sp
.lp
Greg Kemnitz served as chief programmer and was responsible for
overall coordination of the project and for individually implementing the
.q "everything else"
portion of the system.
.lp
This manual was collectively written by
the above implementation team,
assisted by Michael Stonebraker and Claire Mosher.
