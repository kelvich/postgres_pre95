is the name of the \*(PP user to be created.
The name must be unique
among all \*(PP users.

are the same as in the terminal monitor - they are used to connect to the
postmaster using the TCP/IP port
.i port
running on the database server
.i hostname.
The defaults are to the local machine (localhost) and to the default port
(4321).
