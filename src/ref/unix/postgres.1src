.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(PG backend server can be executed directly from the user shell.
This should be done only while debugging by the DBA, and should not be
done while other \*(PG backends are being managed by a
.IR postmaster
on this set of databases.
.PP
The optional argument
.IR dbname
specifies the name of the database to be accessed.
.IR Dbname
defaults to the value of the
.SM USER
environment variable.
.PP
The 
.IR postgres
server understands the following command-line options:
.TP 5n
.BR "-B" " n_buffers"
If the backend is running under the 
.IR postmaster ,
.IR "n_buffers"
is the number of shared-memory buffers that the
.IR "postmaster"
has allocated for the backend server processes that it starts.  If the
backend is running standalone, this specifies the number of buffers to
allocate.  This value defaults to 64.
.TP
.BR "-E"
Echo all queries.
.TP
.BR "-P" " filedes"
.IR "filedes"
specifies the file descriptor that corresponds to the socket (port) on
which to communicate to the frontend process.  This option is 
.BR not
useful for interactive use.
.TP
.BR "-Q"
Specifies \*(lqquiet\*(rq mode.
.TP
.BR "-d" " debug_level"
Turns on debugging at the numeric level
.IR "debug_level" .
Turning on debugging will cause query parse trees and query plans to
be displayed.
.TP
.BR "-o" " output_file"
Sends all debugging and error output to 
.IR output_file .
If the backend is running under the 
.IR postmaster ,
error messages are still sent to the frontend process as well as to
.IR output_file ,
but debugging output is sent to the controlling tty of the
.IR postmaster
(since only one file descriptor can be sent to an actual file).
.TP
.BR "-s"
Print time information and other statistics at the end of each query.
This is useful for benchmarking or for use in tuning the number of
buffers.
.SH "DEPRECATED COMMAND OPTIONS"
There are several other options that may be specified, used mainly
for debugging purposes.  These are listed here only for the use of
\*(PG system developers.
.BR "Use of any of these options is highly discouraged" .
Furthermore, any of these options may disappear or change at any time.
.TP
.BR "-A" "n|r|b|Q\fIn\fP|X\fIn\fP"
Turns on memory manager tracing; 
.BR An
prints allocations/deallocation events when they occur,
.BR Ar
enables silent record-collection,
.BR Ab
enables both record-collection and event-printing,
.BI AQ n
prints recorded events each 
.IR n
tuples processed, and 
.BI AX n
prints recorded events each 
.IR n
transactions processed.
.IP
This option generates a tremendous amount of output.
.TP
.BR "-C"
Don't check whether database metadescriptions (i.e.,
.SM PG_VERSION
files) are consistent.
.TP
.BR "-L"
Turns off the locking system.
.TP
.BR "-N"
Disables use of newline as a query delimiter.
.TP
.BR "-S"
Indicates that the transaction system can run with the assumption of
stable main memory, thereby avoiding the necessary flushing of data
and log pages to disk at the end of each transaction system.  This is
only used for performance comparisons for stable vs. non-stable
storage.  Do not use this in other cases, as recovery after a system
crash may be impossible when this option is specified in the absence
of stable main memory.
.TP
.BR "-b"
Enables generation of bushy query plan trees (as opposed to left-deep
query plans trees).  These query plans are not intended for actual
execution; in addition, this flag often causes \*(PG to run out of
memory.
.TP
.BR "-f"
Forbids the use of particular scan and join methods:
.IR s " and " i
disable sequential and index scans respectively, while
.IR n ", " m " and " h
disable nested-loop, merge and hash joins respectively.
This is another feature that may not necessarily produce executable
plans.
.TP
.BR "-p"
Indicates to the backend server that it has been started by a 
.IR postmaster
and make different assumptions about buffer pool management, file
descriptors, etc.
.TP
.BR "-t" "pa[rser]|pl[anner]|e[xecutor]"
Print timing statistics for each query relating to each of the major
system modules.  This option cannot be used with
.BR "-s" .
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ipcclean(unix),
monitor(unix), 
postmaster(unix).
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
Of the nigh-infinite number of error messages you may see when you
execute the backend server directly, the most common will probably be:
.TP
.BR "semget: No space left on device"
If you see this message, you should run the
.IR ipcclean
command.  After doing this, try starting
.IR postgres
again.  If this still doesn't work, you probably need to configure
your kernel for shared memory and semaphores as described in the
installation notes.
