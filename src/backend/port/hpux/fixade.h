 *	This cheesy hack turns ON unaligned-access fixup on H-P PA-RISC;
 *	the resulting object files contain code that explicitly handles
 *	realignment on reference, so it slows memory access down by a 
 *	considerable factor.  It must be used in conjunction with the +u 
 *	flag to cc.  The #pragma is included in c.h to be safe since EVERY 
 *	source file that performs unaligned access must contain the #pragma.

 *	This is so bogus.  The HP-UX 9.01 compiler has totally broken
 *	struct initialization code.  It actually length-checks ALL 
 *	array initializations within structs against the FIRST one that 
 *	it sees (when #pragma HP_ALIGN HPUX_NATURAL_S500 is defined).. 
 *	we have to throw in this unused structure before struct varlena
 *	is defined.
 *
 *	XXX guess you don't need the #pragma anymore after all :-)
 *	since no one looks at this except me i think i'll just leave
