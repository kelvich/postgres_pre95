/*
 * localam.c --
 *    POSTGRES heap access method "fast" code for temp or "retrieve into"
 *  relations.  NOTE:  Since these relations are not visible to anyone but
 *  the backend that is generating them, this code completely ignores the
 *  multi-user buffer pool and utilities, and is optimized for fast appends.
 *
 *  ! DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR ANYTHING BUT TEMP OR "RETRIEVE INTO" RELATIONS !
 *
 *	mao says 13 oct 92:  what a crock.  the user creates a temp or
 *	'into' relation, and we execute this code to avoid going through
 *	the multi-user buffer pool.  the very next command will have to
 *	fault the pages into the buffer pool in almost every case.  this
 *	is really dumb -- all this complexity for zero benefit.
