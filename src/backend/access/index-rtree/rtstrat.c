 *  Note:  negate, commute, and negatecommute all assume that operators are
 *	   ordered as follows in the strategy map:
 *
 *	left, left-or-overlap, overlap, right-or-overlap, right, same,
 *	contains, contained-by
 *
 *  The negate, commute, and negatecommute arrays are used by the planner
 *  to plan indexed scans over data that appears in the qualificiation in
 *  a boolean negation, or whose operands appear in the wrong order.  For
 *  example, if the operator "<%" means "contains", and the user says
 *
 *	where not rel.box <% "(10,10,20,20)"::box
 *
 *  the planner can plan an index scan by noting that rtree indices have
 *  an operator in their operator class for negating <%.
 *
 *  Similarly, if the user says something like
 *
 *	where "(10,10,20,20)"::box <% rel.box
 *
 *  the planner can see that the rtree index on rel.box has an operator in
 *  its opclass for commuting <%, and plan the scan using that operator.
 *  This added complexity in the access methods makes the planner a lot easier
 *  to write.

 *  Now do the TermData arrays.  These exist in case the user doesn't give
 *  us a full set of operators for a particular operator class.  The idea
 *  is that by making multiple comparisons using any one of the supplied
 *  operators, we can decide whether two n-dimensional polygons are equal.
 *  For example, if a contains b and b contains a, we may conclude that
 *  a and b are equal.
 *
 *  The presence of the TermData arrays in all this is a historical accident.
 *  Early in the development of the POSTGRES access methods, it was believed
 *  that writing functions was harder than writing arrays.  This is wrong;
 *  TermData is hard to understand and hard to get right.  In general, when
 *  someone populates a new operator class, the populate it completely.  If
 *  Mike Hirohama had forced Cimarron Taylor to populate the strategy map
 *  for btree int2_ops completely in 1988, you wouldn't have to deal with
 *  all this now.  Too bad for you.
 *
 *  Since you can't necessarily do this in all cases (for example, you can't
 *  do it given only "intersects" or "disjoint"), TermData arrays for some
 *  operators don't appear below.
 *
 *  Note that if you DO supply all the operators required in a given opclass
 *  by inserting them into the pg_opclass system catalog, you can get away
 *  without doing all this TermData stuff.  Since the rtree code is intended
 *  to be a reference for access method implementors, I'm doing TermData
 *  correctly here.
 *
 *  Note on style:  these are all actually of type StrategyTermData, but
 *  since those have variable-length data at the end of the struct we can't
 *  properly initialize them if we declare them to be what they are.

 *  By filling in all the data, we let him get away with leaving holes in his
