This is an implementation of ``No-Overwrite B-trees'' (actually B-link
tree, ala Lehman and Yao) written by Mark Sullivan and Mike Olson.
The algorithms are described in:

Sullivan, M.; Olson, M.
An index implementation supporting fast recovery for the POSTGRES storage
 system.
Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Data
 Engineering, Tempe, AZ, USA, Feb. 1992, p. 293-300.

You are hereby warned that it hasn't been compiled, let alone run, in
quite some time.
