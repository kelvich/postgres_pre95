/*
 * shmem.c -- create shared memory and initialize shared memory
 *	data structures.
 *
 * Identification:
 *	$Header$
 *
 * POSTGRES processes share one or more regions of shared memory.
 * The shared memory is created by a postmaster and is "attached to"
 * by each of the backends.  The routines in this file are used for
 * allocating and binding to shared memory data structures.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *	(a) There are three kinds of shared memory data structures
 *  available to POSTGRES: fixed-size structures, queues and hash 
 *  tables.  Fixed-size structures contain things like global variables
 *  for a module and should never be allocated after the process 
 *  initialization phase.  Hash tables have a fixed maximum size, but
 *  their actual size can vary dynamically.  When entries are added
 *  to the table, more space is allocated.  Queues link data structures 
 *  that have been allocated either as fixed size structures or as hash 
 *  buckets.  Each shared data structure has a string name to identify 
 *  it (assigned in the module that declares it).
 *
 *	(b) During initialization, each module looks for its
 *  shared data structures in a hash table called the "Binding Table".
 *  If the data structure is not present, the caller can allocate
 *  a new one and initialize it.  If the data structure is present, 
 *  the caller "attaches" to the structure by initializing a pointer 
 *  in the local address space.  
 * 	The binding table has two purposes: first, it gives us
 *  a simple model of how the world looks when a backend process 
 *  initializes.  If something is present in the binding table,
 *  it is initialized.  If it is not, it is uninitialized.  Second,
 *  the binding table allows us to allocate shared memory on demand
 *  instead of trying to preallocate structures and hard-wire the
 *  sizes and locations in header files.  If you are using a lot
 *  of shared memory in a lot of different places (and changing
 *  things during development), this is important.
 *
 *	(c) memory allocation model: shared memory can never be 
 *  freed, once allocated.   Each hash table has its own free list,
 *  so hash buckets can be reused when an item is deleted.  However,
 *  if one hash table grows very large and then shrinks, its space
 *  cannot be redistributed to other tables.  We could build a simple
 *  hash bucket garbage collector if need be.  Right now, it seems
 *  unnecessary.
 *
 *   	See InitSem() in sem.c for an example of how to use the
 *  binding table.
