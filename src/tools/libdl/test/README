This directory contains test suites for the Ultrix 4.x Dynamic Loader Library
Package. 

The tests are:

(1) main 
    uses foo.o, bar.o and baz.o. Tests lazy symbol resolution.

(2) call_mf
    uses mathfunc.o and /usr/lib/libm_G0.a. Tests searching of the math
    library.

(3) abc
    uses libabc.a (containing a.o, b.o and c.o). Tests loading in of a
    library.

(4) jumbo
    uses jumboobj.o. Miscellaneous tests.

Expected results of the four tests are in *.OUT.

Good Luck!
