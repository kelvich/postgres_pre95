Ultrix 4.x Dynamic Loader Library Version 1.0
=============================================

The Dynamic Loader Library implements a simple dlopen/dlsym/dlclose
interface similar to those on other platforms for shared libraries. Since
there is no such thing as shared libraries on Ultrix, it works with
object files and libraries.

The dynamic loader has been compiled and tested on a DECstation/5000 under
Ultrix 4.2.

A brief summary of the features are listed below:

o   can load in object files as well as libraries
o   has an automatic library search mechanism by which you can specify
    libraries like libc_G0.a to be searched for undefined symbols
o   the dynamically loaded text section has the proper memory protection
    so that you cannot accidentally overwrite the code in memory

For more information, there are two brief man pages in the man directory.
The test directory contains sample test suites.
